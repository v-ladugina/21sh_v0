# 21sh

21sh is a shell interpreter which is compliant with the [POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) standard. It is totally coded in C language with very strict limitation of allowed functions from the C-Standard Library. The line editting features and the **vim mode** are implemented by the help of the **Termcaps** library knowing that **Ncurses** library is forbidden. Additionally Lex/Yacc are also forbidden so I had to code the Lexer/Parser from scratch for lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis.
